If you add a new properties file that you want referenced from the TextHelper, you'll need to add a reference to it in the config file:
ks-ap/ks-ap-framework/src/main/resources/META-INF/ks-ap/ks-ap-config.xml

Add the new reference to the ks.ap.TextHelper.resourceBundleNames param.
Only need the package and file name excluding the extension and locale (if necessary)
