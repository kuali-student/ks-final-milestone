# If you set this to false, any error raised from within your app will bubble 
# up to your step definition and out to cucumber unless you catch it somewhere
# on the way. You can make Rails rescue errors and render error pages on a
# per-scenario basis by tagging a scenario or feature with the @allow-rescue tag.
#
# If you set this to true, Rails will rescue all errors and render error
# pages, more or less in the same way your application would behave in the
# default production environment. It's not recommended to do this for all
# of your scenarios, as this makes it hard to discover errors in your application.

# If you set this to true, each scenario will run in a database transaction.
# You can still turn off transactions on a per-scenario basis, simply tagging 
# a feature or scenario with the @no-txn tag. If you are using Capybara,
# tagging with @culerity or @javascript will also turn transactions off.
#
# If you set this to false, transactions will be off for all scenarios,
# regardless of whether you use @no-txn or not.
#
# Beware that turning transactions off will leave data in your database 
# after each scenario, which can lead to hard-to-debug failures in 
# subsequent scenarios. If you do this, we recommend you create a Before
# block that will explicitly put your database in a known state.
