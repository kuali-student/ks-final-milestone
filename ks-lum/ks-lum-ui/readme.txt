HOW TO COMPILE & RUN GWT HOSTED MODE
=====================================

Setting up Maven Run Configuration in Eclipse
---------------------------------------------
	It is recommended that you set up eclipse run configurations to run mvn commands from within eclipse.
	For example, to setup run config for maven command: "mvn -P build-codehaus-gwt compile", do the following:
	
	1. Right click on pom and chose [Run As]->[Maven build...]
	2. Under Goals enter "compile"
	3. Under Profiles enter "build-codehaus-gwt"
	4. Click run

Run Services
-------------
	*** if you are not using rice, you will need to turn off authentication ***
	create or update the file {user.home}\kuali\main\dev\ks-config.xml to include this: 
	<config>
		<param name="ks.ignore.rice.login">true</param>
	</config>
	
	The following services are needed by the UI in addition to the LUM services in lum-web:
	ks-core-web:
	- MessageService
	- OrganizationService
	- ProposalService
	- DocumentService
	- CommentService
	KS-Rice-Standalone (needed for workflow operations):
	* If using any other modules besides the KSB, rice can NOT be run in Derby. 
	* All KSB instances must use the same DB, so if you are using workflow you MUST NOT use Derby for the KSB. 

Run/Debug hosted mode using launch script
-----------------------------------------
	1. Run "mvn -P build-codehaus-gwt compile" from cmd line (or use equivalent eclipse maven run configuration)
	2. In Eclipse right click LumGWT.launch and select [Run As]->[LumGWT] or [Debug As]->[LumGWT]
	
Run hosted mode using gwt maven plugin
--------------------------------------
	NOTE: Running gwt hosted mode via the plugin does work yet due do dependencies on Kuali Rice 
	
	Run either of the following from command line or maven run configuration in eclipse
	
	"mvn -P build-codehaus-gwt compile gwt:gwt" OR "mvn -P build-codehaus-gwt test"
	 

Notes regarding Hosted Mode browser
-----------------------------------
- Changes to client side java files are reflected by simply hitting the "Refresh" button in hosted mode browser
- Changes to server side code requires, you to restart the hosted mode browser
- Debugger only works when hosted mode is started with launch file
