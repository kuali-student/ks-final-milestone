 * These are the copy methods to be used to copy rules from one object to another.

 * For now this will just be a simple interface for a hunk of code that does the copying.
 * Later we will evaluate if we can/should push this into the KRMS rules service proper.
 * 
 * Note: This file refers to multiple methods but there is just one right now.
 * We will see as we move through the use cases if this single method is fine grained enough
 * to copy the rules we need to copy and just those rules.
