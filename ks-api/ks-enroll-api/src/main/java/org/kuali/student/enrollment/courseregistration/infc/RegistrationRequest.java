/**
 * All changes to a student registration is performed by submitting a
 * RegistrationRequest. This request represents an overall transaction
 * among a set of RegistrationRequestItems (register, add, drop,
 * update, etc.)
 *
 * For every transactional operation from the application, a new
 * Request is created.
 *
 * RegistrationRequests are created and persisted separate from the
 * submission and processing. Updating a RegistrationRequest prior to
 * submission can create the concept of a "cart." Once the
 * RegistrationRequest is submitted for porcessing it cannot be
 * updated.
 * 
 * The RegistrationRequest State represents the state of this request
 * e.g. NEW, DRAFT, SUBMITTED, FAILED.
