	<!-- ********************************************************
		                       NOTE
		          THIS FILE WAS INTENDED TO BE MODIFIED

		While this file was originally generated on Wed Apr 11 10:29:09 EDT 2012, it
		was intended to be subsequently modified by hand.
		It imports a corresponding ks-XXXX-dictionary-generated.xml file, 
		that was also automatically generated by the ContractDocMojo.
		This file gives you the ability to layer on addiditional definitions and constrints
		that are not/cannot be generated simply by reading the service contract.

		The goal of this file is to be able to re-generate the corresponding
		ks-XXXX-dictionary-generated.xml file without affecting these manually entered additions
		that are encoded here.
