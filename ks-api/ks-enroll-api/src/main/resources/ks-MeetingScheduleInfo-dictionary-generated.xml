Date and Time The date and time values for all vCalendar properties are
formatted as a string consistent with the ISO 8601 representation for
combinations of dates and times. Either the basic or extended format is
allowed. The use of UTC, rather than local time, should be used when ever
possible in order to avoid time zone ambiguities. The format for the
complete, basic representation of a date and time value is written in the
following sequence of characters:
&lt;year&gt;&lt;month&gt;&lt;day&gt;T&lt;hour&gt;&lt;minute&lt;second&gt;&lt;type designator&gt; For example,
8:30 AM on April 15, 1996 local time would be written as: 19960415T083000
And the same time in UTC based time would be written as: 19960415T083000Z
Where a value needs to specify a sequence of date and time values, then
the property value is a string made up of a list of date and time values,
separated by the field separator. For example: 19960101T090000Z;
19960201T090000Z; 19960301T090000Z; 19960401T090000Z; ... Time Duration
The values for time duration or periods of time for all vCalendar
properties are formatted as a string conformant with the ISO 8601 basic
representation for duration of time. A given duration of a period of time
is represented by a character string consisting of the designator &quot;P&quot;,
optionally including the number of years followed by the designator &quot;Y&quot;,
optionally including the number of months followed by the designator &quot;M&quot;,
optionally including the number of weeks followed by the designator &quot;W&quot;,
optionally including the number of days followed by the designator &quot;D&quot;.
The sequence can also contain a time component preceded by the designator
&quot;T&quot;, optionally including the number of hours followed by the designator
&quot;H&quot;, optionally including the number of minutes followed by the
designator &quot;M&quot;, optionally including the number of seconds followed by
the designator &quot;S&quot;. For example: P6W A period of six weeks; PT15M A
period of 15 minutes; PT1H30M A period of 1 hour and thirty minutes; or
P2Y10M15DT10H30M20S A period of 2 years, 10 months, 15 days, 10 hours, 30
minutes, and 20 seconds.
